Hello! My name is D, but calling me kernelchaotic or chaotic is fine as well. 
I am currently in the process of learning and practicing Python, with the want to eventually take on JavaScript and Scala.
My end goal is to be able to land a job as either a software developer or software engineer; the field does not matter to me.
I love working with numbers, and problem solving is my strongest skill, so coding and debugging come naturally to me!

You can contact me for anything at deanaalise@gmail.com. Unfortunately, I don't have any other public media available.
Thank you for stopping by! Please feel free to leave any constructive criticism or feedback :)
